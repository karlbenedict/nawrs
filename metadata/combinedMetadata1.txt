To meet the requirements  of the Act, the Chippewa Cree Tribe and the North Central Montana Regional Water Authority developed and submitted a water conservation plan to Reclamation. The purpose of this water conservation plan is to ensure that users of water from the core system, non-core system and the on-reservation water distribution systems use the best practicable technology and management techniques to conserve water. Existing distribution systems delivering water to off-reservation users will receive wholesale water from this project.

Parties: Chippewa-Cree Tribe and NCM-RWS.  The Rocky Boy/North Central Montana Regional Water System Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-331)  authorized construction of the Rocky Boy/North Central Montana Regional Water System in north-central Montana. To meet the requirements of the Act, the Chippewa Cree Tribe and the North Central Montana Regional Water Authority developed and submitted a water conservation plan to Reclamation. The purpose of this water conservation plan is to ensure that users of water from the core system, non-core system and the on-reservation water distribution systems use the best practicable technology and management techniques to conserve water. Existing distribution systems delivering water to off-reservation users will receive wholesale water from this project. The plan covers 1) statement of purpose, scope, agreements & terms; 2) a description of the project; 3) water resources inventory; 4) water management problems, goals, objectives and opportunities; 5) existing water conservation measures; 6) additional water conservation measures considered; 7) additional water conservation measures; 8) selected measures and project results; 9) environmental review; and 10) implementation schedule for adoption of plan and budget.

The timetable set forth in the Settlement Agreement has not been met. The irrigation water provisions cannot be met due to Endangered Species Act, biological opinions and Federal Water Pollution Control Act requirements which reduce the amount that can be drawn from the Animas and La Plata Rivers.

To compensate the Tribes, capital costs are waived and funds for natural resource enhancement are provided. 57,100 acre-feet annually may be diverted from the Animas River to the Southern Ute and Mountain Ute Tribes for municipal and industrial needs. The Navajo Nation receives 2,340 a/f and various amounts go to Colorado and water commissions once the Animas-La Plata Project is constructed.

MCA 85-20-301 (1991). The statute ratifies Compact between Northern Cheyenne, MT and US. This Compact resolves all water claims by the Northern Cheyenne within MT so long as the Tongue River Reservoir is repaired and expanded.  Pre-existing stock water, domestic and municipal water uses are recognized. Tribe has right to 32,500 a/f/y of direct flow and storage from the Tongue River Basin (and first rights to excess) with a priority date of Oct. 1, 1881 provided that actual depletion does not exceed 9,375 a/f/y.  Tribe retains an additional 7,500 a/f/y via Water Purchase contract No. 232 dated March 15, 1938. Tribe may divert 1,300 a/f/y from Rosebud Creek for irrigation purposes. An additional 19,530 a/f/y may be diverted from Creek for any purpose, but Tribe may not construct any dams upon it. In lieu of standard surface water diversions from the Tongue River and Rosebud Creek, Tribe may opt for alluvial groundwater.



The Tribe shall administer the Tribal Water Right through a Tribal Water Code. . Tribe shall provide the State with not less than 180-days written notice prior to the start of construction of any project to divert any portion of the Tribal Water Right from the Big Horn River or the Big Horn Reservoir for use on the Reservation, or from the Tongue River or the Tongue River Reservoir for use on the Reservation in the Rosebud Creek basin.  Tribal Water Right may be used off-reservation. MT shall administer all rights to the use of surface water and groundwater within the Reservation which are not a part of the Tribal Water Right. There shall be established a Northern Cheyenne â€“ MT Compact Board to resolve disputes.  



The US shall provide $31.5 million and MT shall provide $16.5 million to repair the Tongue River Dam. The US will pay $10 million for a Tribal Development Fund.
