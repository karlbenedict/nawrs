It serves both as settlement agreement and state legislation. The Compact sets forth the Tribe\u2019s rights, in all their elements, involving Stoneman Reservoir, East Fork Reservoir, Gravel Coulee, Lower Big Sandy Creek, Ancestral Missouri River Channel Aquifer, Box Elder Creek, Beaver Creek, Camp Creek, Duck Creek, Gorman Creek, Lake Elwell, Bonneau Reservoir, Brown\u2019s Reservoir, and new impoundments.\u00a0 It identifies rights in groundwater and direct flow water as well as storage rights and rights to waters originating on the Reservation. The Compact identifies purposes of use including irrigation, stockwatering, evaporation, fish and wildlife enhancement, domestic, municipal, and other non-irrigation uses. The Compact addresses some limitations on any change of use or place of use. It addresses water rights on newly acquired lands and state law water rights. It provides for use of some water off Reservation. The Compact provides for tribal administration of its water on and off the Reservation, including leasing; the creation of a Tribal Water Resources Department and the creation of a Tribal water code. The water will be administered by the DOI Secretary until a code is adopted. The Compact provides for application of MT law and Tribal permits in the case of off-reservations use, change in use or transfer of a Tribal water right and provides for reporting. \u00a0It places limits on new Tribal groundwater development and addresses reservoir operations. A Chippewa-Cree-MT Compact Board created to address enforcement issues.

Overall plan is to find enough water to irrigate 4,000 acres with a duty of 4.5 a/f/y and support 18,350 acres with a duty of 1 a/f/y. of urban development. With an exception for the Verde River Spill Water, total diversion (all from above Granite Reef Dam) is limited to 36,350 a/f/y.

In times of shortage, water will be released from Verde River reservoirs to first satisfy the Kent, and then those rights of the Tribe and Phoenix. The Tribe's maximum diversion right is slightly greater than its entitlement to agreed-upon returns. Tribe shall file its water usage report annually with the Gila River Adjudication.

If the San Juan River water is insufficient, the Nation agrees to make a maximum of 12,000 acre-feet available for Shiprock municipal uses and the Hogback-Cudei and Fruitland-Cambridge irrigation projects; depletions from Navajo Dam shall count against the Nation's rights to deplete the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project. NM may administer priority water rights in the San Juan, including those of the Nation, as necessary to comply with interstate compacts. If the Upper Colorado River Commission determines NM must curtail water consumption, the Nation agrees to not exercise its depletion rights for a period of time. NM shall consult with the Nation on appropriations of both surface and groundwater. The Nation may divert groundwater for use in the AZ portion of San Juan River Basin.  The Bureau of Reclamation will construct the facilities. NM agrees to deposit $1 million in each of 10 fiscal years for ditch improvement.

MCA 85-20-301 (1991). The statute ratifies Compact between Northern Cheyenne, MT and US. This Compact resolves all water claims by the Northern Cheyenne within MT so long as the Tongue River Reservoir is repaired and expanded.  Pre-existing stock water, domestic and municipal water uses are recognized. Tribe has right to 32,500 a/f/y of direct flow and storage from the Tongue River Basin (and first rights to excess) with a priority date of Oct. 1, 1881 provided that actual depletion does not exceed 9,375 a/f/y.  Tribe retains an additional 7,500 a/f/y via Water Purchase contract No. 232 dated March 15, 1938. Tribe may divert 1,300 a/f/y from Rosebud Creek for irrigation purposes. An additional 19,530 a/f/y may be diverted from Creek for any purpose, but Tribe may not construct any dams upon it. In lieu of standard surface water diversions from the Tongue River and Rosebud Creek, Tribe may opt for alluvial groundwater.



The Tribe shall administer the Tribal Water Right through a Tribal Water Code. . Tribe shall provide the State with not less than 180-days written notice prior to the start of construction of any project to divert any portion of the Tribal Water Right from the Big Horn River or the Big Horn Reservoir for use on the Reservation, or from the Tongue River or the Tongue River Reservoir for use on the Reservation in the Rosebud Creek basin.  Tribal Water Right may be used off-reservation. MT shall administer all rights to the use of surface water and groundwater within the Reservation which are not a part of the Tribal Water Right. There shall be established a Northern Cheyenne â€“ MT Compact Board to resolve disputes.  



The US shall provide $31.5 million and MT shall provide $16.5 million to repair the Tongue River Dam. The US will pay $10 million for a Tribal Development Fund.

Tribal Land groups 1-5 have a priority of Oct. 3, 1861, except for water supplied from storage in the Central Utah Project (having one priority for all users), and land groups have a priority of Jan. 5, 1882, unless indicated otherwise in the Tabulation. The tribe shall have a depletion right of 10,000 acre-feet of water annually from the Green River with a priority of Oct. 3, 1861 for M&I purposes. This amount shall include reserved rights for domestic, municipal industrial or related uses. No water allocated pursuant to this Compact shall be subject to loss or forfeiture.
